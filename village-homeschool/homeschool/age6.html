            <div class="scripture">"And it came to pass that I, Nephi, said unto my father: I will go and do the things which the Lord hath commanded..." — 1 Nephi 3:7</div>
            <strong>Faith Thought:</strong> Nephi didn't know *how* he would get the plates, but he knew God would help him. When you have a hard chore or school task today, remember Nephi's courage.
