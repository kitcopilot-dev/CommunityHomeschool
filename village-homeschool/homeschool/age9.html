            Word of the Day: PERSEVERANCE (Persistence in doing something despite difficulty or delay in achieving success.)
        </div>

            <div class="scripture">"For I know that the Lord giveth no commandments unto the children of men, save he shall prepare a way for them..." — 1 Nephi 3:7</div>
            <strong>Faith Thought:</strong> Sometimes "the way" God prepares involves a lot of work from us. Nephi had to try three times to get the plates! Think of something you've had to try many times to get right.
            <br><strong>Activity:</strong> Write down three things you are working on that require "Perseverance."

                <p><strong>Density:</strong> Gold is one of the densest elements. A small cube of gold is much heavier than a same-sized cube of iron. Find three objects in your house and guess which one is the most dense.</p>
