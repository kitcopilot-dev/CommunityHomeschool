            Word of the Day: PERSEVERANCE (Continued effort to do or achieve something despite difficulties, failure, or opposition.)

            <div class="scripture">"I will go and do the things which the Lord hath commanded, for I know that the Lord giveth no commandments unto the children of men, save he shall prepare a way for them..." — 1 Nephi 3:7</div>
            <strong>Faith Thought:</strong> This scripture is often used to show God's power, but notice Nephi's proactive stance: "I will go and do." God provides the "way," but we provide the "feet." How can you apply this balance of faith and action to your personal goals this week?
            <br><strong>Activity:</strong> Study the context of 1 Nephi chapters 3 and 4. List the obstacles Nephi faced and how his perseverance led to the "way" being opened.

                <p>The "Welcome Stranger" gold nugget (71.08 kg) was found today in 1869. 
                1. If the current price of gold is $P per ounce, and 1 kg = 35.274 ounces, write an equation for the total value (V) of the nugget.
                2. Calculate V if P = $2,000.</p>
