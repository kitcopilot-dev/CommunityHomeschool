  <h2>📖 Reading — The Power of Diplomacy</h2>
  <div class="ans"><span class="tag tag-comp">Comprehension</span> <strong>1.</strong> The phrase means that <strong>words, agreements, and peaceful negotiations</strong> can be more powerful and effective than <strong>weapons and warfare</strong>. Writing a treaty or signing an agreement can solve problems that fighting cannot.</div>
  <div class="ans"><span class="tag tag-comp">Comprehension</span> <strong>2.</strong> The <strong>Treaty of Versailles (1919)</strong> — ended World War I; and the <strong>Camp David Accords (1978)</strong> — brought peace between Egypt and Israel.</div>
  <div class="ans"><span class="tag tag-inf">Inference</span> <strong>3.</strong> Smaller nations were unhappy because <strong>the three leaders made major decisions about Europe without consulting the countries most affected</strong>. This reveals that diplomacy can be <strong>unfair when only the most powerful nations have a voice</strong> — smaller countries may have no say in decisions that directly impact them.</div>
  <div class="ans"><span class="tag tag-anal">Analysis</span> <strong>4.</strong> The author uses a <strong>balanced, two-sided structure</strong>. They do not present only one side. First, they argue diplomacy is effective (with examples). Then, they acknowledge counterarguments — that diplomacy can be unfair and that Yalta had flaws. Finally, they conclude that despite its imperfections, diplomacy is still better than war. Evidence: "However, diplomacy is far from a simple process…" and "Critics have argued…"</div>
  <div class="note">📝 <strong>Question 5 is open-ended.</strong> Accept either agreement or disagreement as long as it is supported with 3–4 sentences of reasoning and evidence from the text. Look for: a clear position, at least one piece of textual evidence, and logical reasoning. <em>Example (agreeing): "I agree because the passage shows that diplomacy ended WWI and brought peace to the Middle East. Even though it isn't perfect, the author is right that war causes even more damage."</em></div>

  <h2>✏️ Writing — Essay Rubric & Sample</h2>
  <div class="note">📝 <strong>Rubric — look for:</strong><br>
  ✓ Two full paragraphs<br>
  ✓ Paragraph 1 accurately describes both events (Mormon Migration + Yalta)<br>
  ✓ Paragraph 2 discusses the impact of each event on the U.S./world<br>
  ✓ At least one similarity and one difference identified<br>
  ✓ Clear topic sentences and a concluding thought<br>
  ✓ Proper grammar, capitalization, and punctuation<br>
  ✓ Demonstrates independent thinking — not just a summary</div>
  <div class="ans">
    <strong>Sample answer:</strong><br><br>
    "Two important events in American and world history took place on February 4 — decades apart. In 1846, Mormon pioneers left Nauvoo, Illinois after being attacked by angry mobs. They traveled over 1,000 miles by wagon and on foot to reach Utah, a journey that took more than a year. Nearly 100 years later, in 1945, U.S. President Roosevelt, British Prime Minister Churchill, and Soviet leader Stalin met at the Yalta Conference to plan the end of World War II and the future of Europe.<br><br>
    Both events shaped the world in lasting ways. The Mormon migration helped settle the American West and showed the determination of people seeking freedom. The Yalta Conference, on the other hand, shaped global politics — it helped end WWII but also led to the Cold War when Stalin broke his promises. While one was a personal journey of survival and the other was a political summit, both events remind us that the decisions people make — whether on a dusty trail or in a conference room — can change history forever."
