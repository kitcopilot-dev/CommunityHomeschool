    <div class="scripture">
        <h2>📖 Scripture of the Day</h2>
        <p><strong>Doctrine & Covenants 88:118</strong></p>
        <p>"Seek ye diligently and teach one another words of wisdom; yea, seek ye out of the best books words of wisdom; seek learning, even by study and also by faith."</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faith-thought">
        <h2>💭 Faith Thought</h2>
        <p><strong>Learning Makes You Stronger!</strong></p>
        <p>Heavenly Father wants us to learn new things every day! When we study math, science, reading, and history, we're following His commandment to seek wisdom. And when we pray for help understanding something hard, we're learning by faith too!</p>
        <p><strong>Morning Prayer Idea:</strong> Before you start your assignments, say a quick prayer like this: "Heavenly Father, please help me understand what I'm learning today and help me see how it can help me and others."</p>
    </div>

    <h2>📝 Word of the Day</h2>
    <div class="activity">
        <p><span class="word-highlight">Curious</span> (adjective): Eager to learn or know something; interested in learning new things.</p>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> "The curious student asked lots of questions about how volcanoes work."</p>
        <p><strong>Your turn:</strong> Write a sentence about something you're curious about!</p>
    </div>

    <h2>🕰️ This Day in History</h2>
    <div class="activity">
        <p><strong>February 6, 1952:</strong> Princess Elizabeth became Queen Elizabeth II of England when she was just 25 years old. She became queen because her father, King George VI, passed away. She would go on to be queen for over 70 years—longer than any other British king or queen in history!</p>
        <p><strong>Fun Fact:</strong> When she became queen, she was in Kenya, Africa, watching wild animals! Imagine getting such big news while on an adventure!</p>

    <h2>📜 History</h2>
    <div class="activity">
        <h3>The Space Race - Going to the Moon! 🚀</h3>
        <p>In the 1960s, two powerful countries—the United States and the Soviet Union (now called Russia)—were in a race to see who could get to space first, and then to the Moon!</p>
        
        <p><strong>Important Events:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>1957:</strong> The Soviet Union sent the first satellite, Sputnik, into space. It was a metal ball that beeped!</li>
            <li><strong>1961:</strong> Soviet astronaut Yuri Gagarin became the first person to go to space.</li>
            <li><strong>1969:</strong> American astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin landed on the Moon! Neil Armstrong was the first person to walk on it and said, "That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind."</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>Assignment:</strong> Draw a picture of an astronaut on the Moon. Include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The astronaut in a space suit</li>
            <li>The American flag they planted</li>
            <li>The lunar module (the spaceship they landed in)</li>
            <li>The Earth in the distance</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Then write 3-5 sentences about what you think it would be like to walk on the Moon!</p>
    </div>

    <h2>🔬 Science</h2>
    <div class="activity">
        <h3>The Moon - Earth's Natural Satellite</h3>
        <p>Since we're learning about the Moon landing today, let's learn about our Moon!</p>
        
        <p><strong>Cool Moon Facts:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>The Moon is about 1/4 the size of Earth.</li>
            <li>The same side of the Moon always faces Earth.</li>
            <li>There's no air or water on the Moon.</li>
            <li>Astronauts who walked on the Moon weighed much less there because the Moon's gravity is weaker than Earth's.</li>
            <li>The footprints astronauts left on the Moon are still there today because there's no wind to blow them away!</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>Moon Phases:</strong> The Moon seems to change shape during the month. These are called phases!</p>
        <ul>
            <li>🌑 <strong>New Moon:</strong> You can't see it</li>
            <li>🌓 <strong>First Quarter:</strong> Half moon (right side lit up)</li>
            <li>🌕 <strong>Full Moon:</strong> Complete circle</li>
            <li>🌗 <strong>Last Quarter:</strong> Half moon (left side lit up)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>Assignment:</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Draw the 4 main Moon phases shown above.</li>
            <li>Look at the Moon tonight (if it's clear). Draw what shape you see and label which phase it is.</li>
            <li>Write down: Why do you think God created the Moon? (Think about light at night, ocean tides, beauty, etc.)</li>
        </ol>

    <div class="bonus">
        <h3>🎉 BONUS: Friday Kitchen Science Experiment!</h3>
        <p><em>Optional fun activity - ask a parent to help!</em></p>
        
        <h4>🧪 Experiment: Dancing Raisins Rocket Science!</h4>
        
        <p><strong>Materials:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Clear glass or plastic cup</li>
            <li>Clear soda (Sprite, 7-Up, or club soda)</li>
            <li>10-12 raisins</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>What to Do:</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Fill the glass almost to the top with clear soda.</li>
            <li>Drop in the raisins.</li>
            <li>Watch what happens for 5-10 minutes!</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p><strong>What's Happening?</strong></p>
        <p>The soda has tiny bubbles of carbon dioxide gas in it (that's what makes it fizzy!). When the raisins sink to the bottom, the bubbles stick to the wrinkly surface of the raisins. The bubbles act like tiny balloons and lift the raisins up to the top! When the raisins reach the top, the bubbles pop, and the raisins sink back down. Then it happens all over again!</p>
        
        <p><strong>This is like a rocket!</strong> Just like the gas bubbles push the raisins up, rocket fuel creates powerful gases that push rockets up into space. The astronauts who went to the Moon used really big rockets with super powerful fuel to escape Earth's gravity!</p>
        
        <p><strong>Try This:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>What happens if you use fresh soda vs. flat soda?</li>
            <li>Try other small objects like popcorn kernels or small pasta. What works best?</li>
            <li>Count how many times a raisin goes up and down in 5 minutes!</li>
        </ul>
