    <div class="scripture">
        <h2>📖 Scripture of the Day</h2>
        <p><strong>Doctrine & Covenants 88:118</strong></p>
        <p>"And as all have not faith, seek ye diligently and teach one another words of wisdom; yea, seek ye out of the best books words of wisdom; seek learning, even by study and also by faith."</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faith-thought">
        <h2>💭 Faith Thought</h2>
        <p><strong>Learning by Study AND Faith</strong></p>
        <p>This verse teaches us that true education combines intellectual effort with spiritual understanding. As you study today, remember that knowledge becomes wisdom when we seek the Lord's guidance. Take a moment before your studies to pray for understanding and insight.</p>
        <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> As you work through today's assignments, pause before each subject and ask yourself: "How can I see God's hand in this?" Whether it's the order in mathematics, the lessons of history, or the wonder of science—all truth testifies of our Creator.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>📝 Word of the Day</h2>
    <div class="activity">
        <p><span class="word-highlight">Catalyst</span> (noun): A substance that speeds up a chemical reaction without being consumed; a person or thing that precipitates change or action.</p>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> "The discovery of electricity was a catalyst for the Industrial Revolution."</p>
        <p><strong>Your turn:</strong> Write a sentence using "catalyst" to describe something or someone who inspired positive change in your life or community.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>🕰️ This Day in History</h2>
    <div class="activity">
        <p><strong>February 6, 1952:</strong> Queen Elizabeth II became Queen of the United Kingdom after the death of her father, King George VI. At age 25, she began a reign that would become the longest in British history, lasting over 70 years until her passing in 2022.</p>
        <p><strong>Reflection:</strong> Elizabeth II served with dedication and duty throughout her life. How can we show similar commitment to our responsibilities, whether in family, church, or community?</p>
    </div>

    <h2>🔢 Mathematics</h2>
    <div class="activity">
        <h3>Algebraic Expressions & Polynomials</h3>
        <p><strong>Today's Focus:</strong> Factoring Quadratic Expressions</p>
        
        <p><strong>Review:</strong> A quadratic expression in the form ax² + bx + c can often be factored into two binomials.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Practice Problems:</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Factor: x² + 7x + 12</li>
            <li>Factor: x² - 5x + 6</li>
            <li>Factor: 2x² + 7x + 3</li>
            <li>Factor: x² - 9 (difference of squares)</li>
            <li>Challenge: Factor: 3x² - 11x - 4</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p><strong>Real-world application:</strong> The trajectory of a basketball follows a parabolic path. If the height h (in feet) of a shot is modeled by h = -16t² + 20t + 6, where t is time in seconds, factor this expression and determine when the ball hits the ground (h = 0).</p>
    </div>

    <h2>📜 History</h2>
    <div class="activity">
        <h3>The Cold War Era: Space Race</h3>
        <p>The Space Race (1955-1972) was a competition between the United States and Soviet Union for supremacy in spaceflight capability. It had its origins in the nuclear arms race between the two nations following World War II.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Key Events:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>1957:</strong> Soviet Union launches Sputnik 1, the first artificial satellite</li>
            <li><strong>1961:</strong> Yuri Gagarin becomes the first human in space (Soviet)</li>
            <li><strong>1969:</strong> Apollo 11 lands on the Moon (USA) - Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin</li>
            <li><strong>1972:</strong> End of Apollo program</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>Assignment:</strong> Research and write a 2-paragraph essay on one of these topics:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Why was the Space Race significant beyond just reaching the Moon?</li>
            <li>What technologies developed for space exploration do we use in everyday life?</li>
            <li>How did the Space Race affect American education and science programs?</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>🔬 Science</h2>
    <div class="activity">
        <h3>Chemistry: Chemical Reactions & Catalysts</h3>
        <p>Building on today's Word of the Day, let's explore catalysts in chemistry!</p>
        
        <p><strong>What is a Catalyst?</strong></p>
        <p>A catalyst is a substance that increases the rate of a chemical reaction without being permanently changed itself. Catalysts work by lowering the activation energy needed for a reaction to occur.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Examples in Nature:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Enzymes</strong> are biological catalysts. Amylase in your saliva breaks down starches into sugars.</li>
            <li><strong>Chlorophyll</strong> catalyzes photosynthesis in plants.</li>
            <li><strong>Iron</strong> in hemoglobin helps catalyze oxygen transport in your blood.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>Assignment:</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Draw a diagram showing how a catalyst lowers activation energy in a reaction.</li>
            <li>Research one industrial process that uses a catalyst (ex: catalytic converters in cars, Haber process for ammonia).</li>
            <li>Write 3-4 sentences explaining why catalysts are important for both living organisms and industrial processes.</li>
        </ol>

        <div class="experiment-section">
            <h4>🧪 Experiment: DIY Catalyst - Hydrogen Peroxide Decomposition</h4>
            
            <p><strong>Materials:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Hydrogen peroxide (3% from medicine cabinet)</li>
                <li>Active dry yeast</li>
                <li>Warm water</li>
                <li>Clear glass or jar</li>
                <li>Dish soap (optional, for dramatic effect)</li>
                <li>Food coloring (optional)</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><strong>Procedure:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Pour about 1/2 cup hydrogen peroxide into the glass.</li>
                <li>(Optional) Add a squirt of dish soap and a few drops of food coloring.</li>
                <li>Mix 1 tablespoon of yeast with 3 tablespoons of warm water. Stir for 30 seconds.</li>
                <li>Pour the yeast mixture into the hydrogen peroxide.</li>
                <li>Watch what happens!</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p><strong>What's Happening?</strong></p>
            <p>Hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) naturally decomposes into water (H₂O) and oxygen gas (O₂), but this process is usually very slow. The enzyme <em>catalase</em> in yeast acts as a catalyst, dramatically speeding up this decomposition. The oxygen gas produced creates bubbles and foam (especially if you added soap). The reaction also produces heat—feel the outside of the glass!</p>
            
            <p><strong>The Chemistry:</strong> 2H₂O₂ → 2H₂O + O₂</p>
            
            <p><strong>Challenge Questions:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>What evidence do you see that a gas is being produced?</li>
                <li>Why does the container feel warm?</li>
                <li>What would happen if you used more yeast? Less yeast?</li>
                <li>Try the experiment with cold vs. hot hydrogen peroxide. What difference do you notice?</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><strong>Connection to Life:</strong> Your body produces hydrogen peroxide as a byproduct of cellular processes. The enzyme catalase in your cells breaks it down constantly to prevent damage. This same enzyme is what's making the bubbles in your experiment!</p>
