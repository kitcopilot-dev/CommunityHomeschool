        <h3>Going to the Moon! 🚀🌙</h3>
        <p>A long time ago, in 1969, some very brave people called astronauts went to the Moon! The Moon is very far away—it takes 3 days to get there in a spaceship!</p>

            <li>Another astronaut named Buzz Aldrin walked on the Moon too!</li>
            <li>They wore special suits because there's no air on the Moon to breathe.</li>
            <li>They planted an American flag on the Moon! 🇺🇸</li>
            <li>When they jumped, they went really high because the Moon doesn't pull as hard as Earth does!</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>The Moon - Our Night Light! 🌙</h3>
        <p>Let's learn about the Moon!</p>
        
        <p><strong>What is the Moon?</strong></p>
        <p>The Moon is like Earth's best friend in space! It goes around and around Earth. At night, we can see it shining in the sky.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Fun Moon Facts:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>The Moon is much smaller than Earth. 🌍 vs 🌙</li>
            <li>The Moon doesn't make its own light—it reflects light from the Sun! ☀️</li>
            <li>Sometimes the Moon looks like a full circle. Sometimes it looks like a banana! 🍌</li>
            <li>There's no water on the Moon, and no plants or animals either.</li>
            <li>Heavenly Father made the Moon to give us light at night! How nice! ✨</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>Activity:</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Tonight, look at the Moon (if you can see it). Is it a full circle, a half circle, or a crescent (banana shape)?</li>

        <h3>🎉 BONUS: Friday Kitchen Science Experiment!</h3>
        <p><em>Optional fun activity - ask Mom or Dad to help!</em></p>
        
        <h4>🧪 Experiment: Moon Craters!</h4>
        
        <p><strong>What You Need:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>A baking pan or shallow dish</li>
            <li>Flour (enough to fill the pan about 1 inch deep)</li>
            <li>Cocoa powder or cinnamon</li>
            <li>Small rocks, marbles, or balls of different sizes</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>What to Do:</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Fill the pan with flour and smooth it out flat.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle a thin layer of cocoa powder or cinnamon on top.</li>
            <li>Drop the rocks or marbles from different heights into the flour.</li>
            <li>Look at the "craters" they make!</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p><strong>What's Happening?</strong></p>
        <p>The Moon has lots of round holes called <strong>craters</strong>. These craters were made when big space rocks (called meteorites) crashed into the Moon a long, long time ago! Your experiment shows how those craters were formed.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Try This:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Drop a small marble. Then drop a big rock. Which makes a bigger crater?</li>
            <li>Drop from low. Then drop from high. What's different?</li>
            <li>The harder something hits, the bigger the crater! That's what happened on the real Moon!</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>God's Creation:</strong> The Moon is part of God's beautiful creation! He made it to light up the night and to be something wonderful for us to look at. Isn't Heavenly Father amazing? 🌙✨</p>
