# Village Homeschool: Parent Daily Workflow Guide

Welcome to Village! This guide outlines how to use the app effectively on a day-to-day basis to manage your family's homeschooling journey.

## 🌅 Morning: Planning & Kickoff

1.  **Check the Family Dashboard**: Start your day here for a high-level overview. Review the "Recent Activity" feed to see what was accomplished yesterday and check the family-wide progress stats.
2.  **Review the Weekly Schedule**: 
    *   Navigate to **Manage Kids** and open each child's **Learning Vault**.
    *   Switch to the **📅 Weekly Schedule** tab.
    *   This shows exactly which courses are active for "Today" based on the Active Days (e.g., M/W/F) you configured.
    *   Use this to set expectations with your children for their day's work.

## 📖 During the School Day: Tracking Progress

1.  **Advance Lessons Instantly**:
    *   As a child finishes a lesson, go to their **Overview** tab in the Learning Vault.
    *   Click the **Next Lesson →** button next to the course.
    *   The progress bar and lesson count update immediately, giving instant visual feedback.
2.  **Capture Portfolio Moments**:
    *   Did they finish a beautiful art project or a complex science experiment?
    *   Go to the **🎨 Portfolio** tab in their Learning Vault.
    *   Click **➕ Add Project** to upload a photo or PDF sample. This builds their "Yearbook" automatically as you go.

## 📝 Afternoon/Evening: Grading & Review

1.  **Log Graded Assignments**:
    *   For work that needs a specific score (quizzes, tests, essays), go to the **Assignments** page.
    *   Click **+ New Assignment** to log the work item, subject, and score.
    *   If you haven't graded it yet, leave the score blank; it will show as "🕒 Pending" until you Blur/Save the score later.
2.  **Monitor Academic Health**:
    *   Return to the **Dashboard**.
    *   Scroll down to the **📊 Grading Analytics** section.
    *   Review the real-time **GPA by Student**, **Subject Averages**, and **Grade Distribution** to see where they are excelling or where they might need more support.
3.  **Check the Academic Calendar**:
    *   Visit the **Calendar** page to see how many school days are remaining in the year.
    *   Ensure no upcoming breaks or holidays have been missed in your planning.

## 🎓 Milestone: Generating Records

1.  **Generate Transcripts**:
    *   Whenever you need an official record (for state compliance, sports, or personal records), go to the **Transcript** page.
    *   Select the child and click **🖨️ Print / Export PDF**.
    *   This pulls all your daily tracking, portfolio logs, and assignment scores into a professional document automatically.
