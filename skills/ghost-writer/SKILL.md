# Ghost Writer

This skill helps you draft and refine professional product documentation.

## Guidelines

1.  **Drafting a PRD**:
    *   Start by reading [prd-template.md](references/prd-template.md).
    *   If market context is missing, use [market-research-guide.md](references/market-research-guide.md) to perform research.
    *   Focus on the *Value Proposition* and *User Experience* before diving into tech.

2.  **Creating a Technical Spec**:
    *   Read [spec-template.md](references/spec-template.md).
    *   Ensure all data models and logic flows are explicitly defined.
    *   Prioritize *Security* and *Scalability* for decentralized apps.

3.  **Refinement**:
    *   Compare the current draft against the templates to identify missing sections.
    *   Ask clarifying questions if the vision or technical constraints are ambiguous.

4.  **Formatting**:
    *   Always provide a Markdown version.
    *   Optionally provide an HTML version for browser viewing if requested.
