1.  **Competitor Analysis**: 
    *   Who are the market leaders in this space?
    *   What are their primary features and pricing models?
    *   What are the common user complaints or gaps in their offerings?

2.  **Market Size & Trends**:
    *   What is the estimated Total Addressable Market (TAM)?
    *   What are the emerging trends for 2026 and beyond?

3.  **Technical Precedents**:
    *   Are there existing open-source protocols or libraries that can be leveraged?
    *   How have similar problems been solved in other domains?

4.  **Regulatory/Legal Landscape**:
