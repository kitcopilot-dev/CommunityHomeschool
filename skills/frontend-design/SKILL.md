# Frontend Design

This skill guides the creation of distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces that avoid generic "AI slop" aesthetics. Implement real working code with exceptional attention to aesthetic details and creative choices.

## Design Thinking

Before coding, understand the context and commit to a BOLD aesthetic direction:

- **Purpose**: What problem does this interface solve? Who uses it?
- **Tone**: Pick a distinct flavor: brutally minimal, maximalist chaos, retro-futuristic, organic/natural, luxury/refined, playful/toy-like, editorial/magazine, brutalist/raw, art deco/geometric, soft/pastel, industrial/utilitarian, etc.
- **Constraints**: Technical requirements (framework, performance, accessibility).
- **Differentiation**: What makes this UNFORGETTABLE? What's the one thing someone will remember?

**CRITICAL**: Choose a clear conceptual direction and execute it with precision. Bold maximalism and refined minimalism both work - the key is intentionality, not intensity.

Implement working code that is:
- Production-grade and functional
- Visually striking and memorable
- Cohesive with a clear aesthetic point-of-view
- Meticulously refined in every detail

## Frontend Aesthetics Guidelines

### Typography
- Choose fonts that are beautiful, unique, and interesting.
- Avoid generic fonts like Arial, Roboto, or Inter.
- Opt for distinctive choices (e.g., from Google Fonts or similar) that elevate the aesthetics.
- Pair a distinctive display font with a refined body font.

### Color & Theme
- Commit to a cohesive aesthetic. Use CSS variables for consistency.
- Dominant colors with sharp accents outperform timid, evenly-distributed palettes.
- Vary between light and dark themes based on the chosen tone.

### Motion
- Use animations for effects and micro-interactions.
- Prioritize CSS-only solutions for vanilla HTML/CSS.
- Use libraries like Framer Motion for React when available.
- Focus on high-impact moments: staggered reveals on load, scroll-triggered states, and surprising hover interactions.

### Spatial Composition
- Use unexpected layouts: asymmetry, overlap, diagonal flow, grid-breaking elements.
- Balance generous negative space with controlled density.

### Backgrounds & Visual Details
- Create atmosphere and depth rather than defaulting to solid colors.
- Apply creative forms: gradient meshes, noise textures, geometric patterns, layered transparencies, dramatic shadows, custom cursors, and grain overlays.

## What to Avoid
- **Generic AI Aesthetics**: Overused font families (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system fonts).
- **Cliche Color Schemes**: Purple gradients on white backgrounds.
- **Predictable Layouts**: Cookie-cutter design that lacks context-specific character.

Interpret requirements creatively. No two designs should look the same. Match implementation complexity to the aesthetic vision.
