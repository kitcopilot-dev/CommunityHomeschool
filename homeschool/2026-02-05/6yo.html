        <h3>Faith-Based Learning</h3>
        <p><strong>Scripture of the Day:</strong> James 1:5 - "If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him."</p>
        <div class="activity">
            <p><strong>Faith Thought & Activity:</strong> Just like Joseph Smith, we can ask Heavenly Father for help when we don't know what to do. <strong>Activity:</strong> Think of one thing you want to learn or a question you have. Kneel down and say a prayer asking for "wisdom" or help to learn it today.</p>
